This handout supports **Cybersecurity Merit Badge requirement 5(c)** items about passwords, MFA, and system security.

## Part 1 – Strong Passwords

1. Write down **three** *weak* passwords someone might use (do not use your real passwords).

   - Weak password 1: ___________________________________________  
   - Weak password 2: ___________________________________________  
   - Weak password 3: ___________________________________________  

2. For each weak password above, rewrite it as a **stronger password or passphrase** (do not use a real password you plan to use; these are examples only).

   - Stronger version 1: ________________________________________  
   - Stronger version 2: ________________________________________  
   - Stronger version 3: ________________________________________  

3. Checklist – What makes a strong password? Mark the ones you used:

- [ ] Long (at least 12–16 characters)  
- [ ] Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols  
- [ ] Not based on your name, birthday, or username  
- [ ] Not reused on multiple sites  
- [ ] Easy for you to remember, hard for others to guess (passphrase)
