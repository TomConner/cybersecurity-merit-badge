---

## Protecting Your Digital Footprint :material-incognito:

**Do:**

- Lock down **social media** profiles.  
- Turn off unnecessary **location sharing**.  
- Review **app permissions** regularly.  
- Avoid posting: home address, school schedule, daily routine.

> **Speaker notes (counselor):** Quick demo of privacy settings on a test account if possible. Emphasize “share with friends, not with the whole world.”

**Scout Law in Cyberspace**

- **Trustworthy** – Don’t lie, cheat, or impersonate others online.  
- **Helpful** – Report cyberbullying or scams.  
- **Kind** – No harassment or pile-ons on social media.  

> **Speaker notes (counselor):** Ask Scouts to pick a Scout Law point and give one “online” example. Write a few on a board.  
> Link: [Scout Law](https://www.scouting.org/about/faq/question10)

---

## Ethical vs. Unethical Behavior :material-gavel:

**Ethical:**

- Reporting a vulnerability instead of abusing it.  
- Respecting others’ privacy and data.  

**Unethical:**

- Using someone’s unlocked phone or computer.  
- Shoulder-surfing passwords.  
- “Just looking around” in systems you’re not authorized to use.

> **Speaker notes (counselor):** Present 2–3 scenarios and have Scouts vote thumbs-up/ thumbs-down on whether it’s ethical.  
> Link: [CompTIA – Ethical Issues in Cybersecurity](https://www.comptia.org/blog/ethical-issues-in-cybersecurity)

## 4. Threats, Vulnerabilities, Attacks :material-alert-octagon:

![Threats and Attacks](images/threats.png)

**Key terms**

- **Vulnerability** – a weakness or flaw.  
- **Threat** – something that can exploit the weakness.  
- **Exploit** – the actual method of attack.

Example: Outdated browser (vulnerability) + malicious site (threat) + exploit code = stolen password.

> **Speaker notes (counselor):** Ask them to describe a real-world analogy (e.g., broken lock, burglar, crowbar).  
> Link: [Khan Academy – Internet, Security](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro)

> Link: [FTC – How to Safely Use Public Wi-Fi](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-safely-use-public-wi-fi)

---

## Spoofing & Phishing :material-fish:

- **Spoofing** – pretending to be someone else (fake email address, caller ID, website).  
- **Phishing** – tricking you into clicking a bad link or giving away information.

**Warning signs:**

- Urgent threats (“your account will be deleted”).  
- Spelling mistakes or odd grammar.  
- Weird sender addresses or URLs.

> **Speaker notes (counselor):** Show a sample fake email vs real one. Ask Scouts to spot the red flags.  
> Phishing quiz: [Google Phishing Quiz](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com)
