## Counselor Tips

- Keep examples age-appropriate and concrete (social media, gaming, school laptops).
- Use real but not sensational breach stories.
- Emphasize *protecting people*, not just computers.
- Encourage Scouts to complete hands-on tasks on **their own devices only**, with parent/guardian permission.
